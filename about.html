													My name is Ben. I am born in Melbourne Australia and have lived here all my life.
													I recently graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor's degree in Science, majoring
													in Computing and Software Systems.
													<br><br>
													I started coding during my time at University, where I learnt the fundamentals of computing and worked with
													many different languages. These include Java, Python, HTML/CSS and many others. Throughout my study, I have
													also had the chance to work with others on projects, giving me an idea of what it is like to work collaboratively
													on code.
													<br><br>
													Outside of coding, my passion is playing fighting games. Since 2020, I have been helping out volunteering at 
													Brofist Gaming, an organisation that runs social events for people like me to gather and play fighting games.
													After graduating, I have also been lucky enough to travel around the world and represent Australia for Tekken 7.
													Some places I have had the opportunity to visit include Japan, Romania and Amsterdam.
